`plug_graphql` is a [Plug](https://github.com/elixir-lang/plug) integration for the [GraphQL Elixir](https://github.com/graphql-elixir/graphql) implementation of Facebook's GraphQL.

This [Plug](https://github.com/elixir-lang/plug) allows you to easily mount a GraphQL endpoint in Phoenix. This example project shows you how:

* [Phoenix GraphQL example project](https://github.com/graphql-elixir/hello_graphql_phoenix)

## Installation

  1. Make a new Phoenix app, or add it to your existing app.

  ```sh
  mix phoenix.new hello_graphql
  cd hello_graphql
  ```

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/graphql-elixir/hello_graphql_phoenix
  ```

  2. Add `plug_graphql` to your list of dependencies and applications in `mix.exs` and install the package with `mix deps.get`.

  ```elixir
  def application do
    # Add the application to your list of applications.
    # This will ensure that it will be included in a release.
    [applications: [:logger, :plug_graphql]]
  end

  def deps do
    [{:plug_graphql, "~> 0.3.1"}]
  end
  ```

## Usage

  1. Define a simple schema in `web/graphql/test_schema.ex`:

  ```elixir
  defmodule TestSchema do
    def schema do
      %GraphQL.Schema{
        query: %GraphQL.Type.ObjectType{
          name: "Hello",
          fields: %{
            greeting: %{
              type: %GraphQL.Type.String{},
              args: %{
                name: %{
                  type: %GraphQL.Type.String{}
                }
              },
              resolve: {TestSchema, :greeting}
            }
          }
        }
      }
    end

    def greeting(_, %{name: name}, _), do: "Hello, #{name}!"
    def greeting(_, _, _), do: "Hello, world!"
  end
  ```

  2. Your `api` pipeline should have this as a minimum:

  ```elixir
  pipeline :api do
    plug :accepts, ["json"]
  end
  ```

  3. Mount the GraphQL endpoint as follows:

  ```elixir
  scope "/api" do
    pipe_through :api

    forward "/", GraphQL.Plug, schema: {TestSchema, :schema}
  end
  ```

  4. Start Phoenix

  ```sh
  mix phoenix.server
  ```

  5. Open your browser to `http://localhost:4000/api?query={greeting}` and you should see something like this:

  ```json
  {
    "data": {
      "greeting": "Hello, world!"
    }
  }
  ```
